# Outline 4.2, Experiments

- Scientific questions can be addressed using data from observational experiments or studies
- It is important to only change one variable so that the difference between the results after testing is very likely to be in correlation to the variable that you are changing
- If the explanatory variable is influenced by other fields, it can become confounded and the relation between the response variable and the explanatory variable will be much lower than otherwise
- Observational studies are often misleading as the massive amount of factors that go into the result cloud the relation that is being studied
- In a study, treatments are imposed on subjects, or experimental units if they are not humans
- Every treatment is made up of changes in the environment, called factors
- Experimentation should include:
    - Comparison of treatments
    - Control treatment
    - Random assignment
    - Replicatability
- Completely random designs have everyone getting the exact same chance
- Placebos help experiments by eliminating the psychological aspect of testing and giving better and more accurate results
- Double blind experiments are when both the surveyor and the subject have no knowledge about the treatment
- If one know about the treatment, it is only single-blind
- If the result is very significant, then it is statistically significant
- Blocking together the treatments can create a more distributed and fair set in exchange for true randomness
