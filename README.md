We support the following formats:
```

```

Also, some conventions for naming your notes:

1. Words must be seperated with a hypen, e.g. `this-is-a-note.md`
2. Underscores are replaced with periods, e.g. `lesson-1_3 => Lesson 1.3`
3. Notes must be added two levels deep, with the following standard:
```<section>/<catagory>/your-note.<extention>```
